=== Goals

. Execute and coordinate the improvement activities to eliminate problems and issues found during <<Analyze, analysis>>. There is a whole <<improve-practices, bunch of practices>> devoted to this step, and we described the different  <<improve-approaches-overview, approaches>> you can take to run the improvements.

. Apply selected opportunities for improvement

* Change code, structures, concepts or processes to achieve better software,
* Reduce costs and/or technical debt,
* Eliminate all kinds of issues,
* Optimize quality attributes (like performance, maintainability, security),
* Optimize operation and administration processes, thereby reducing effort and cost.



=== Structure of the Improvement Phase

image::improve-fundamentals-approaches-practices.png["improve-concepts", title="Overview of Improvement Concepts"]


[horizontal]
<<improve-fundamentals, Fundamentals>>:: Some principles which you should consider
whatever steps you take on your road to improvement.

<<improve-approaches-overview, Approaches>>:: Overall (strategic, long-term) decisions how to
tackle improvement, structured in several categories. Start with the <<improve-approaches-overview, overview>>
or jump right to the <<improve-approaches-details, details>>.

<<improve-practices, Practices>>:: fine-grained practices or patterns, structured in
several categories. Start with the <<improve-practices-overview, overview>> or jump
right to the <<improve-approaches-details, details>>.


We'll cover these topics in a top-down manner, starting with a brief overview of the respective
categories available for approaches and practices.




[[improve-fundamentals]]
=== Fundamentals
For improvement we take a number of fundamental principles for granted,
depicted in <<improve-fundamentals>>.


.Improvement Fundamentals - Overview
image::improve-fundamentals.png[]

These fundamental principles surely belong to software engineering good practices -
but we consider them indispensable for improvement projects.

[horizontal]
[pattern]#Fast-Feedback#::
Get feedback to your actions and changes as early as possible, so you can adjust as quickly as adequate.

[pattern]#Improve Iteratively#::
Improve in (potentially small) iterations and/or increments, so
that change does not disturb or negatively affect the system, its associated
processes and organization. Iterations are the prerequisite for our whole _phased improvement_.

[pattern]#Prototype-Improvement#:: Verify the viability and effectiveness of improvements,
usually in smaller scales with reasonable risks.

[pattern]#Verify-After-Every-Change#:: Always make sure that changes,
even minor ones, leave your system intact. (The awesome Jerry Weinberg has written
up several http://secretsofconsulting.blogspot.de/2015/01/some-very-expensive-software-failures.html[examples of such failures]).

[pattern]#Reduce Complexity#:: Simpler solutions are most often easier to comprehend,
maintain and operate. Therefore always strive for simplicity and the reduction
of accidental, unnecessary complexity.

[pattern]#Explicit Assumption#:: Compensate missing facts (especially requirements, goals, estimates, opinions) by explicit (written) assumptions about those facts. See <<Explicit-Assumption>>.

[pattern]#Group Improvement Actions#:: Group related actions, so that they refer
to similar entities and potential synergies are utilized.

=== Improvement Approaches (Overview)

.Categories of Improvement Approaches
image::improve-approaches-categories.png[]

[horizontal]
Data Migration::
Keep your (valuable) data, and toss (or rewrite or otherwise change) your code. Oftentimes
combined with approaches from the categories _rewrite_ or _restructure_.

Rewrite::
Your system is _broken beyond repair_ and you need to completely replace it by a new one.
Rewrite approaches give you some ideas how and if that might work (spoiler: we fear that [pattern]#Big-Bang# won't work...)

Restructure::
Improve your system by restructuring your code _in-the-large_. Might involve extraction of
certain functionalities, splitting your system, improving the modularization or strangulating
certain (bad) parts of the system (and, of course, replacing those by better solutions).

Improve Modularization::
Subcategory of _restructure_: improve responsibilities within the system, improving the boundaries between components, improving interfaces and similar operations.

Brainsize::
Evidence from neuroscience suggests our working memory has a capacity of about four items footnote:[Cowan: The magical number 4 in short-term memory: a reconsideration of mental storage capacity.]. That's why smaller solutions tend to be more maintainable, as the cognitive load on the developers working memory is reduced. These "brainsizing" strategies can be used to reduce the amount of _stuff_, e.g. by splitting your system up, extracting certain parts into abstractions, or other ways to reduce LOC or other complexity metrics. Terms like _microservices_ fall into this category.

Improve-Domain-Focus::
Subcategory of _restructure_:Clear separation of domain-related code from purely technical aspects has long been a useful design heuristic - but is still often violated.
In addition, aspects belonging to similar areas of the domain should be implemented within the same building-blocks (in Domain-Drive Design terminology called _Bounded Context_).

=== Improvement Practices (Overview)

.Categories of Improvement Practices
image::improve-practice-categories.png[]


[horizontal]
Improve Processes and Organization::
Sometimes your issues originate in process or organizational root causes,
meaning your development, rollout or operations processes are less efficient
than they should be. This category adresses such problems.
For details see <<improve-processes>>.

Improve Architecture and Code Structure::
All aspects of sourcecode may be subject to improvement - style, structure,
dependencies, conventions, naming and the like. Furthermore, structure
_in the large_ (modules, components, interfaces) or crosscutting and technical
concepts belong to this area of improvement.
For details see <<improve-architecture>>.

Improve Technical Infrastructure::
Technical infrastructure encompasses both underlying hardware and software.
For details see <<improve-technical-infrastructure>>.


Improve Analyzability and Evaluatability::
Make the system easier to analyze and understand, e.g. by improving logging,
tracing or by introducing clearer structures.
Enable or facilitate evaluation (e.g. of certain issues) by creating, collecting
and managing certain numbers (_metrics_),
either in development-, deploy- or runtime.
For details see <<improve-analyzability>>.



=== Approaches, Practices and Regular Development
In regular development (sometimes known as _daily business_) you will most likely intertwine
your approach(es) with numerous practices - as depicted in
<<fig-relation-of-approaches-practices>>.

In both long- and short-term planning (yes - even in highly agile and iterative
  development models you'll have such planning) you need to balance the following
  often conflicting goals:

  * short-term profitability by creating business value by delivering
    features or fixes to production.
  * long-term maintainability of the system by improving inner quality,
    improving code structure, technology choices and the like.
