==== [pattern]#Capture Quality Requirements# 

===== Intent
Make the specific quality requirements of a system explicit.


===== Description

Invite authoritative stakeholders to a joint workshop (e.g. half- or full-day). 
Let them write _quality scenarios_ to describe their specific quality requirements for the system. Moderate this workshop.

* Use _scenarios_ to formulate specific quality requirements.
* Order those scenarios within a mostly hierarchical quality tree, similar to <<ISO-9126>>.

* explain quality tree
* explain brainstorming session, moderated workshop

====== Scenario-based Quality Description

Scenario:: describes the reaction of a system to a certain event (or type of event).


image::quality-scenario.png["quality scenario", title="Structure of Quality Scenarios", id="quality-scenario-diagram"]

Although this definition is concise, it needs some explanation to become understandable. See figure <<quality-scenario-diagram>>:

* An _event_ can be
** a user clicking a button
** an administrator starting or stopping the system
** a hacker trying to get unauthorized access.
* An _event_ can also be
** a manager needing another feature
** another manager wanting to reduce operation costs
** some government agency requiring financial data to be tamper-proof

.Example scenario "Mandatory changes to Business Processes"*

[%autowidth,cols="2*"]
|===
|Context
|The individual processing step AB within use case XY is declared invalid by the regulatory authority and removed from the system. The data processed by the system is not affected.

|Business Goal(s)
|The needed changes to the use case XY can be carried out at low cost and without negative effects.

|Trigger
|The legislator, represented by the regulatory authority, prohibits the use of the AB processing step.

|Reaction
|A developer or architect removes the AB processing step in the system (by deleting the corresponding calls or reconfiguring the process flows).

|Target value
|The change requires a maximum of 24 hours with a maximum of 48 person-hours of effort. After this time, the system is fully working again.


|Constraints
|This change has no effect on the existing data of the users/customers in the system regarding the XY application case. An (automatic) migration of some data is permitted, but must not exceed the 24-hour limit.

Such a scenario makes it clear to everyone that not only business functionality is needed to achieve the project's goals.
It makes technical requirements (in the example above: modifiability) visible to non-technical stakeholders by providing traceability from the business goal to the technical details.


===== Experiences

* *Needs moderation*: Brainstorming quality requirements usually works well in moderated workshops. If given (even trivial) examples, every stakeholder will most likely write down several scenarios. We often received 80-120 different scenarios in one-day workshops.
* *Uncovers problems and risks*: Scenarios collected within brainstorming sessions often contain _hidden_ problem descriptions, risks or problems with the current systems.
* *Covers organization and process*: Scenarios sometimes cover process or organizational aspects (like release cycles should be faster than they are now). Move those to your <<Improvement-Backlog>>.
* *Improves human communication*: Different stakeholders often start communicating about the system or their requirements during such workshops. This kind of interaction _should_ have happened long before...


===== Applicability
Use this practice when (authoritative) stakeholders are available for discussion or a workshop.

If you have well-documented, specific and current (!) quality requirements available, you might consider skipping this practice for now (although we're quite sure it's a good opportunity to learn a lot about the system, its stakeholders, their requirements and opinions).

===== Consequences

* The required constraints (aka quality attributes) of a system are made explicit.


===== Also Known As
* Non-functional requirements (although this term is misleading, as _functional_ requirements strongly influence the _quality_ of any system!)
* Documentation of quality requirements.
