=== [pattern]#Widen Your Options#
Before taking decisions it's often a good idea to widen your decision space,
look for additional options. Sometimes it's not only "yes-or-no" decisions,
but a spectrum of additional options are available - at least if you allow
your brain to deviate from conventional path or your own preliminary conclusions.
