[[Architectural-Understanding]]
=== [pattern]#Architectural-Understanding#

Develop and document an understanding of internal structures, concepts, architectural approaches  and important decisions of the <<System>>.


==== Description

Collect and organize architectural information about the <<System>>: 
Document structures, concepts, decisions, interfaces etc. of the <<System>>
to _locate_ issues, risks and opportunities for improvement.
 
* Business or technical system context, with external interfaces. Learn this
  from <<Context-Analysis>> or <<Infrastructure-Analysis>>.

* Solution strategy, often to be learnt from <<Stakeholder-Interview>> with
  experienced developers of the system.

* Building block structure, the static organization of the source code. 
  At least elaborate the highest level of code blocks (level 1 building blocks)

* Runtime structures, like important use-case scenarios. Sometimes this can be
  learned from <<Runtime-Analysis>>.

* Infrastructure and deployment, often derived from <<Infrastructure-Analysis>>.

* Cross-cutting and technical concepts, like domain models, persistence,
  user-interface and other concepts.

* Important architecture and design decisions taken and revoked during
  development of the system.


==== Experiences

Architectural understanding can be gained in small increments, so there is no
need to reserve long times just for documentation.

Understanding should come from various sources - see all the <<Analyze>> practices.

* <<arc42>> provides a free and pragmatic template for software architecture
  documentation. It's available in various formats (e.g. Microsoft-Word (tm) and 
  AsciiDoc).
