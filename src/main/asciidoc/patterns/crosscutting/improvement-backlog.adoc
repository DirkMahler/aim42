=== [pattern]#Improvement Backlog#
Keep a public, written backlog of possible improvements, remedies, tactics or strategies.

* Revise this backlog in regular intervalls.
* Define the _owner role_ for this backlog, similar to the _product owner_ in Scrum.
* Enhance the backlog with information from the <<Evaluate>> phase, like cost, effort or risk.

==== Intent
Collect all known issues and problems within a system or its associated processes. Make the issues comparable by evaluating each one, usually using economical units like money or time. Align carefully with <<Issue-List>>.

==== Representation and Tools
Try to use a similar documentation approach like for <<Issue-List>>. It should be
as easy as possible to link issues to improvements and vice versa.
