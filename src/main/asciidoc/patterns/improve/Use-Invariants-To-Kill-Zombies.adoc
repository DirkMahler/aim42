==== [pattern]#Use Invariants To Kill Zombies#

===== Intent

Provide a safe approach in situations where it seems to dangerous to delete
code or whole modules from a huge system because <<Static-Code-Analysis>> can't
recognize whether the code is still in use or not.

===== Description

Oftentimes old systems contain lots of code that probably is no longer in use
but still has to be tended to. Such code puts a burden on every cross-cutting
change - from the year-2000 efforts of the late nineties to the upcoming
end-of-unix-system date rewrites. New processor architectures, new versions of
operating systems with a different handling of the byte-order and all kinds of
external regulations are just some examples for things that make it necessary to
make changes to *all* existing code -- whether it is still in use or not. This
code is deemed dead, but like the proverbial zombie it still goes around and
munches on everybody's brain when it is time for the next system-wide change.

This kind of zombie can be killed more safely by employing invariants. 

An invariant -- as described by Bertrand Meyer in
<<Object-Oriented-Software-Construction>> -- is a logical expression that always
is true for a given set of circumstances. He proposes to actually verify those
invariants _in the code itself_. What happens if the invariant does not hold
true is open to discussion - in some circumstances it's best to <<Fail-Fast, fail-fast>>
but when improving legacy software with hundreds or thousand of users this often
is not an option.

So if we want to make sure we can delete this code our invariant is simple:

.Pseudo-Code
[source,java]
----
assertTrue(false, "We should not be here" + __FILE__ + __LINE__ );
----

How to implement +assertTrue()+ for this case is hard, though.

As just pointed out, the simple “let the program die” approach might not be
appropriate. +
Just logging the fact might not have a sufficient effect. +
Sending an e-mail requires at least some infrastructure (and infrastructure
code) +
Sending an SNMP-Trap might not be feasible in the environment. +

And so on.

This is a classical situation that calls for trade-off decisions, but since this
piece of code should never be called anyway things like sending an e-mail or
calling some web services are not so far out of the question. 

If a huge number of deployments is possible without problems it can also be
feasible to deescalate slowly and use more and more intrusive ways to handle
the failed invariant -- write a log entry in the first two weeks, send an SNMP
trap in the next four weeks and after that send an e-mail (although it doesn't
hurt to keep the logging turned on).

===== Experiences

In several cases this approach helped to delete up to 50% of the code base.

===== Risks

* Sometimes the Zombie is buried to early -- to be on the safe side the
  presumably dead code should live through at least each season. For huge
  systems that really means 366 days.
* The presumably dead code might be called _much_ more often than anticipated -
  in these cases a highly invasive reaction, like sending an e-mail, can lead to
  side-effects that are close to a denial-of-service attack. 

===== Applicability

This pattern can be applied whenever the code-base has gotten too big and there
are parts of the system that are perhaps unused (e.g. dead) but still add to the
weight of the system.

===== Consequences

* Dead code can be safely deleted

===== Related Patterns

* Use <<Static-Code-Analysis>> to find candidates, entry points and exit points.
* Using invariants to kill zombies is a special case of <<Assertions>> in the
  context of architecture improvement.
* Introducing invariants to verify that the code is really dead is a specific
  way to make <<Explicit-Assumption>>s 

===== References
* Invariants (and other <<Assertions>>) have been made popular by Bertrand Meyer
  in his seminal book <<Object-Oriented-Software-Construction>>

* Dead code is an alternate name for the lava-flow anti pattern <<Brown>>.
